Be mindful that training GANs is somewhat of an art\nform, as incorrect hyperparameter settings lead to mode collapse with\nlittle explanation of what went wrong. Here, we will closely follow\nAlgorithm 1 from Goodfellow’s paper, while abiding by some of the best\npractices shown in [ganhacks](<https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks>).\nNamely, we will “construct different mini-batches for real and fake”\nimages, and also adjust G’s objective function to maximize\n$logD(G(z))$. Training is split up into two main parts. Part 1\nupdates the Discriminator and Part 2 updates the Generator.\n\n**Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**\n\nRecall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the\nprobability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In\nterms of Goodfellow, we wish to “update the discriminator by ascending\nits stochastic gradient”. Practically, we want to maximize\n$log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))$. Due to the separate mini-batch\nsuggestion from ganhacks, we will calculate this in two steps. First, we\nwill construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward\npass through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(D(x))$), then\ncalculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct\na batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this\nbatch through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(1-D(G(z)))$),\nand *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the\ngradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we\ncall a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.\n\n**Part 2 - Train the Generator**\n\nAs stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\nminimizing $log(1-D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes.\nAs mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient\ngradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we\ninstead wish to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish\nthis by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the\nDiscriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing\nG’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters\nwith an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real\nlabels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the\n$log(x)$ part of the BCELoss (rather than the $log(1-x)$\npart) which is exactly what we want.\n\nFinally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each\nepoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to\nvisually track the progress of G’s training. The training statistics\nreported are:\n\n-  **Loss_D** - discriminator loss calculated as the sum of losses for\n   the all real and all fake batches ($log(D(x)) + log(1 - D(G(z)))$).\n-  **Loss_G** - generator loss calculated as $log(D(G(z)))$\n-  **D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the discriminator\n   for the all real batch. This should start close to 1 then\n   theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about why\n   this is.\n-  **D(G(z))** - average discriminator outputs for the all fake batch.\n   The first number is before D is updated and the second number is\n   after D is updated. These numbers should start near 0 and converge to\n   0.5 as G gets better. Think about why this is.\n\n**Note:** This step might take a while, depending on how many epochs you\nrun and if you removed some data from the dataset.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Training Loop\n\n# Lists to keep track of progress\nimg_list = []\nG_losses = []\nD_losses = []\niters = 0\n\nprint(\"Starting Training Loop...\")\n# For each epoch\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    # For each batch in the dataloader\n    for i, data in enumerate(dataloader, 0):\n        \n        ############################\n        # (1) Update D network: maximize log(D(x)) + log(1 - D(G(z)))\n        ###########################\n        ## Train with all-real batch\n        netD.zero_grad()\n        # Format batch\n        real_cpu = data[0].to(device)\n        b_size = real_cpu.size(0)\n        label = torch.full((b_size,), real_label, dtype=torch.float, device=device)\n        # Forward pass real batch through D\n        output = netD(real_cpu).view(-1)\n        # Calculate loss on all-real batch\n        errD_real = criterion(output, label)\n        # Calculate gradients for D in backward pass\n        errD_real.backward()\n        D_x = output.mean().item()\n\n        ## Train with all-fake batch\n        # Generate batch of latent vectors\n        noise = torch.randn(b_size, nz, 1, 1, device=device)\n        # Generate fake image batch with G\n        fake = netG(noise)\n        label.fill_(fake_label)\n        # Classify all fake batch with D\n        output = netD(fake.detach()).view(-1)\n        # Calculate D's loss on the all-fake batch\n        errD_fake = criterion(output, label)\n        # Calculate the gradients for this batch, accumulated (summed) with previous gradients\n        errD_fake.backward()\n        D_G_z1 = output.mean().item()\n        # Compute error of D as sum over the fake and the real batches\n        errD = errD_real + errD_fake\n        # Update D\n        optimizerD.step()\n\n        ############################\n        # (2) Update G network: maximize log(D(G(z)))\n        ###########################\n        netG.zero_grad()\n        label.fill_(real_label)  # fake labels are real for generator cost\n        # Since we just updated D, perform another forward pass of all-fake batch through D\n        output = netD(fake).view(-1)\n        # Calculate G's loss based on this output\n        errG = criterion(output, label)\n        # Calculate gradients for G\n        errG.backward()\n        D_G_z2 = output.mean().item()\n        # Update G\n        optimizerG.step()\n        \n        # Output training stats\n        if i % 50 == 0:\n            print('[%d/%d][%d/%d]\\tLoss_D: %.4f\\tLoss_G: %.4f\\tD(x): %.4f\\tD(G(z)): %.4f / %.4f'\n                  % (epoch, num_epochs, i, len(dataloader),\n                     errD.item(), errG.item(), D_x, D_G_z1, D_G_z2))\n        \n        # Save Losses for plotting later\n        G_losses.append(errG.item())\n        D_losses.append(errD.item())\n        \n        # Check how the generator is doing by saving G's output on fixed_noise\n        if (iters % 500 == 0) or ((epoch == num_epochs-1) and (i == len(dataloader)-1)):\n            with torch.no_grad():\n                fake = netG(fixed_noise).detach().cpu()\n            img_list.append(vutils.make_grid(fake, padding=2, normalize=True))\n            \n        iters += 1","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-03T13:33:02.122713Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-03T13:33:02.123471Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-03T14:07:17.716957Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-03T13:33:02.123425Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-03T14:07:17.715962Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Results\n-------\n\nFinally, lets check out how we did.
